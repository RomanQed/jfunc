/**
 * The {@code com.github.romanqed.juni} module provides unified functional interfaces
 * that combine both synchronous and asynchronous execution models.
 * <p>
 * These interfaces extend both sync (from {@code jfunc}) and async (from {@code jfut}) contracts,
 * and expose introspection methods ({@code isSync()}, {@code isAsync()}, {@code isUni()}) to reflect
 * the *original nature* of the implementation â€” whether it was designed as synchronous,
 * asynchronous, or both.
 * <p>
 * This abstraction is useful for frameworks and pipelines that want to optimize dispatch logic
 * without sacrificing portability or backward compatibility across Java versions.
